tracboards - Trac dashboards
============================

tracboards is a collection of TV dashboards used by the Truveris Corps of
Engineers.

Configuration
-------------
To enable and configure tracboards, you need to  add the following to your
Trac configuration file::

    [components]
    tracboards.* = enabled

In addition, you can do some customization on a per-dashboard basis::

    [tracboards]
    defects.ticket_type = Defect

Installation
------------
Build an .egg file and drop it in the plugins directory of your Trac
installation::

    python setup.py bdist_egg

Defect Dashboard
----------------
This dashboard has two panels tracking the state of defects in your trac
project.  The left panel shows all the new and triaged open defects across all
components and milestones with a leader board of the components.  The right
panel shows all the tickets that were closed in the active milestones (with a
due date and no completion date) and a leader board of who closed these
tickets.

Accessible through::

    https://your_trac_install/dashboard/defects

Configuration options::

    [tracboards]
    # Use this if your defect tickets have a different name:
    defects.ticket_type = Defect

Calendar Dashboard
------------------
The calendar dashboard lists milestones events based on templates defined in
the configuration file.  You can also define events in the Trac wiki using
specific key words.

Accessible through::

    https://your_trac_install/dashboard/calendar

Configuration options::

    [tracboards]
    # Display name of the deployment event.
    calendar.deployment.name = Deployment
    # Font awesome icon used next to the name.
    calendar.deployment.icon = rocket
    # Color of the icon.
    calendar.deployment.color = #445566
    # Number of days before the due date.
    calendar.deployment.delta = -5

Wiki Events will be retrieved from any pages within the ``Events/`` namespace
that contain the right meta data.  The ``Date:`` setting is mandatory, all the
others are optional::

    - Date: 2016-01-05
    - Icon: birthday-cake
    - Color: green

The bullet-list style is optional, you can also put that information in a
comment block.  Each of these options need to be on their own line, they are
case sensitive.  If an event is recurring, you can add the ``Frequency:``
option::

    - Date: 2010-07-14
    - Frequency: yearly
    - Icon: birthday-cake
    - Color: red

By default the title of the page (``= Title =``) will be used as event name,
you can override that by adding ``Name:`` in the meta data.

Sandbox setup
-------------
To easily run Trac + tracboards locally, do the following:
    1. Install Python
    2. Install virtualenv: https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/
    3. From the root source directory, in a shell, create a virtual environment:
        virtualenv venv
    4. Activate the virtual environment:
        . venv/bin/activate
    5. From that same directory, now run /tools/sandbox-make
    6. Then run /tools/sandbox-serve
    7. As the serve output notes, you can now access the sandbox Trac instance at: http://127.0.0.1:5010

Note that the created username and password pair is: sandbox/sandbox
